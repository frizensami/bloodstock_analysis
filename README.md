# Blood Stock Analysis

This repository accompanies the analysis of Singapore's blood stock levels at https://sriramsami.com/bloodstocks.

Note: This is definitely not the most efficient way to analyze the data (one network call per commit).

## Pre-requisites

1. You'll need `python 3+` and `git`
1. Install python packages, either (a) `conda env create -f environment.yml` or (b) `pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib PyGithub`
1. Clone this repository.

## Downloading and analyzing the data

1. Get a GitHub personal access token from https://github.com/settings/tokens/new. The token doesn't need any specific permissions.
1. Run `TOKEN=<your GitHub personal access token> python3 retrieve.py`. This will download the data to the `data/` subfolder. It'll take a few minutes. PRs are welcome to do this sanely (download the repo oneshot and extract the commits offline)
1. When the data is downloaded, run `python3 analyze.py`. This should display the overall graph for blood stocks over time.
